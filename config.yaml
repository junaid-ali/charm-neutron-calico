      Repository from which to install Calico packages. May be one of the
      following options: default, or ppa:somecustom/ppa. Note that this
      must be set before the 'install' hook runs.
  keep-bird-config:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Do not change the BIRD config.  By default, neutron-calico replaces any
      existing BIRD config with one that is suitable for Calico operation with
      a route reflector, with all Calico-managed VM routes being exported to
      that route reflector.  However in real deployments the required BIRD
      config may be more complex than that - for example exporting VM routes to
      multiple route reflectors on parallel fabric networks, or handling
      different sets of routes differently.  Setting this option to True tells
      neutron-calico not to touch the BIRD config, and so allows a deployment
      to provision (by some other means) the BIRD config that it wants, either
      before or after the deployment of this charm.
  openstack-origin:
    default: distro
    type: string

      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include:

      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/updates
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/staging
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/proposed

      For series=Precise we support cloud archives for openstack-release:
         * icehouse

      For series=Trusty we support cloud archives for openstack-release:
         * juno
         * kilo
         * liberty

      NOTE: this option must be set before install.
